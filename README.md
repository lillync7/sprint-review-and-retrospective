How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I interpret user needs and impliment them into a program by looking at not only what they want but what 
would make it work best for them. Creating user stories is a good step toward this. They can be written 
based off of input from potential end users. This will include what feature those users want. With user 
stories the desires of the end users can be used to decide the best method to develope the program. They 
are also good for making sure the required elements are all included in the program and give the opportunity
to decide the order of priority.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Currently I do a lot of planning when working on programs as I am still learning. This tends to involve some 
research in how to do things. As I improve the set up time will be less for developing programs. The agile 
processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work are user stories and teamwork. Really it's 
all of agile, but these two stand out. User stories are a great way to start out with what the needs of a 
program are before starting. This makes the planning process easier. In the case of the teamwork, it is a 
great way to find what works and what doesn't as you go. Teams also offer the opportunity to ask questions
that a lone developer may not have the opportunity to have direct contact to ask. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Good communication makes a good team member. This communication can be by way of face to face, phone or email.
Attending meetings for projects being worked on is also a good way to be a good team member. Meetings are a good 
place to communicate what each person is working on, ask for help or offer help. Participating in meetings is 
also a good way to learn about the project as a whole from other areas outside of the developers tasks. Good 
teamwork between everyone involved only works if each individual team member comminicates about the project with 
the available methods.
